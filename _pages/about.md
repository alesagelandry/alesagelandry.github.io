I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montréal, QC, Canada. I received the B.Eng. degree in Engineering Physics from Polytechnique Montréal, QC, Canada, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2019.
From 2019 to 2020, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Energy & Resources Group at the University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. My research interests include optimization, online learning and their application to power system with renewable generation.

I am currently looking for new graduate students. Students interested in pursing an M.A.Sc or a Ph.D. under my supervision are welcome to contact me. Please include a brief bio, your CV, and recent transcripts.

I am also specifically looking for a Ph.D. student for the following [research project](http://alesagelandry.github.io/MANA_OPF_eng.pdf) to be done in collaboration with my colleague Prof. Mahseredjian. For more information for how to apply, please see the research proposal.
