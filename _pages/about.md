I received the B.Eng. degree in Engineering Physics from École Polytechnique de Montréal, QC, Canada, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2019. 

I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Energy & Resources Group at the University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. My research interests include optimization, online learning and their applications to power system operations.

I will be starting as an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montréal in January 2021. Students interested in pursing an M.A.Sc. or Ph.D. under my supervision are welcome to contact me. Please include a brief bio, your CV, and recent transcripts.
