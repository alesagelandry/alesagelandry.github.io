I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Polytechnique Montréal, QC, Canada. I received the B.Eng. degree in Engineering Physics from Polytechnique Montréal, QC, Canada, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2019.
From 2019 to 2020, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Energy & Resources Group at the University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. My research interests include optimization, online learning and their application to power systems with renewable generation.

<!--I am currently looking for new graduate students at the master and PhD levels for several [research projects](http://alesagelandry.github.io/MScPhD_LORER_eng.pdf). Students interested in pursing an M.A.Sc or a Ph.D. under my supervision are welcome to contact me. For more information on how to apply, please see the research proposal.-->

<!--I am also specifically looking for a PhD student for the following [research project](http://alesagelandry.github.io/PhD_OnlineOptimization_Eng.pdf) on online optimization methods for renewable power systems. For more information on how to apply, please see the research proposal.-->

<!-- I am also specifically looking for a postdoctoral fellow for the following [research project](http://alesagelandry.github.io/ProjDesc_AlliancePDF_eng.pdf) to be done in collaboration with my colleagues [Prof. Dagdougi](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/dagdougui-hanane), [Prof. Audet](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/audet-charles), and [Prof. Le Digabel](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/le-digabel-sebastien). For more information on how to apply, please see the research proposal. -->

<!-- I am also specifically looking for a PhD student for the following [research project](http://alesagelandry.github.io/PhD_NetworkAccess.pdf) in the field of communication systems to be done in collaboration with my colleagues [Prof. Karabulut Kurt](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/karabulut-kurt-gunes). For more information on how to apply, please see the research proposal. -->

I am currently looking for new Ph.D. students for the following projects:
1. [Optimization and learning methods for renewable electric system real-time simulations](http://alesagelandry.github.io/PhD_Simulations_eng.pdf) with my colleagues [Prof. Karabulut Kurt](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/karabulut-kurt-gunes) and [Prof. Berger](https://www.uqar.ca/professeurs/berger-maxime/).
2. [3D Channel and Network Modeling of Drones for Dense and Harmonious Usage of Spectrum](http://alesagelandry.github.io/PhD_3DH_eng.pdf) with my colleague [Prof. Karabulut Kurt](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/karabulut-kurt-gunes).
